# Book Recommender API (AKA Find a Book)
 This is a basic API made up of objects and pushed to Heroku. By searching a word, it brings up a book title, author, genre and summary. It might not be that useful to other users since it's all books and words that I chose myself and not associated with any lists or specific groups. It is a fun project to share with friends, co-workers and family members who like to read.
 
 Libraries, book stores or book-related content creators could use a similar API and client side search on their websites.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node and Heroku.

I created my own server using node and express JS. Then so other people could access the API, I pushed it to Heroku.

The API is made up of objects. 

I ended up adapting a template for the layout of the site. I need to learn more about designing. THe first two attempts at doing my own layout were functional but it was not a very appealing site.

The original input item in the template was an email submission box. I adapted it to instead pull from the API. This is why the mobile layout gets a little funky. It wasn't designed to host the response text. 

## Lessons Learned:

1. How to create a respository and then push to github from the terminal.
2. How to push to heroku.
3. How to create an API.

### If I had more time I would:

1. Have the book's photo come up.
2. Spend more time optimizing the mobile layout.
3. Add more information to the books such as the year they came out.
4. Add some category moduluses that would show words that could be searched. The categories would be things like emotion/mood, adjectives, nouns, or verbs.
5. I also might try using mongoDB.
