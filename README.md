# Book Recommender API (AKA Book Sprout)
 This is a basic API made up of objects and pushed to Heroku. By searching a word, it brings up a book title, author, genre and summary. It might not be that useful to other users since it's all books and words that I chose myself and not associated with any lists or specific groups. It's a bit random.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Heroku.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Lessons Learned:

1. How to create a respository and then push to github from the terminal.
2. How to push to heroku.
3. How to create an API.

### What I Would Add With More Time

I would add more information to the books such as the year they came out.
I thought about adding some category moduluses that would show words that could be searched. The categories would be emotion/mood, adjectives, nouns, verbs or something like that. 
I also might try using mongoDB.
